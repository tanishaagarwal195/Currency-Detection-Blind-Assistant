# Currency-Detection-Blind-Assistant 👓💵

This project is a real-time currency detection system designed to assist visually impaired individuals. It uses a YOLOv8 model for detecting Indian currency notes through a webcam feed and announces the note denomination via audio output.

## 🌟 Features
- Real-time detection using webcam feed.
- Supports Indian currency denominations: ₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, and ₹2000.
- High accuracy of **95%** with YOLOv8.
- Audio output for detected currency, enhancing accessibility for blind users.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository contains the necessary files and scripts for detecting currencies using YOLOv8.


## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Webcam Feed**: Captures live video from the webcam.
2. **YOLOv8 Model**: Processes the image to detect currency notes.
